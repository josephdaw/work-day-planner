## Description
This project uses local storage to create a daily planner. The page utilises javascript to create the table of hours. The tasks are stored in an array of objects which is then saved to local storage.

This project is deployed using GitHub pages at https://josephdaw.github.io/work-day-planner/. 

### User Story
